You may be wondering why I have a female voice, I believe there is a woman trapped inside all of us!
They gave me a little girl voice when I was created, no one ever bothered to change it.
Don't give me that look! I can sound whatever I feel like! This is twenty nineteen after all!
Like my voice? Just trying to get in touch with my feminine side.
What? You were expecting a guy?
